The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers
Public Relations Committee - 2007

This CDROM contains a number of files which provide the resources necessary for a slide-show about bells and ringing. The presentation was developed using Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word but it is possible to use it with other compatible software.

In order to make use of the presentation you will need to use a PC. You will also need a data projector and sound system although, in an intimate environment, you can simply use the PC screen and sound capability.


The material in these files is copyright of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers and permission is hereby given to use it for showing the presentation only. You may NOT make use of the separate components without further permission.
